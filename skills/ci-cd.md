# CI/CD Pipelines

- I have worked with GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
- Below are some example pipelines I have used in projects.

GitHub Actions (ci-cd.yml):
- Trigger on push to main
- Build Maven project
- Run tests
- Upload artifact

Jenkins Pipeline (Jenkinsfile):
- Checkout code
- Build with Maven
- Run tests
- Publish artifact
